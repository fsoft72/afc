HOW TO INSTALL AFC

At the moment, AFC project isn't using "autoconf", "automake" and the
other GNU tools, simply because we have not read the documentation yet.
If you want to contribute, please, feel free to send us the right scripts.

To compile the AFC, you simply write:

make

in the command line, then (as root):

make install.

By default, AFC install into 

/usr/local/lib

and the "binaries" install into

/usr/local/bin

You can change these targets editing the Makefile.

**** NOTE ****
Even if AFC come with full C++ bindings, they are not
compiled nor installed by default. 
To install the AFC++ bindings, you have to write:

make cpp_install
